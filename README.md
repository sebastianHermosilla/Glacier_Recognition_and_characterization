# Glacier_Recognition_and_characterization


Glacier Recognition and Characterization
Overview
Welcome to the Glacier Recognition and Characterization repository. This project focuses on characterizing the Glacier Grey over Torres del Paine, Chile, utilizing various techniques and algorithms. The repository encompasses three main ideas:

1. Area Estimation: Utilizing the normalized difference snow index (NDSI) between bands Green and SWIR16 of the Landsat satellites to estimate the glacier's area.
2. Machine Learning Algorithm Implementation: Developing a machine learning algorithm to detect the glacier using satellite Fasat-Charlie, which lacks the SWIR bands present in Landsat satellites.
3. Calving Events Recognition: Recognizing calving events and estimating their magnitude for further analysis.
